## Golang beginner's 100 days of code log, round 1

## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - start on 2023-12-02

### Day 1: December 02, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 1. Build project, start learning Golang; 2. learn the datatype of Golang.

**Thoughts:** 1. basic data type is so various; 2. composition data: collection type, reference type, interfance type.

**Link to work:** [basic data type part 1](https://github.com/ZarkMedo/golang-beginner/commit/78c779b8508a85a42a2619d6133449cb8e1bdedc)


### Day 4: December 03, 2023

**Today's Progress**: data type part 2, composition type is finished.

**Thoughts:** distinguish value type, reference type, interface type, and how to use the pointer.

### Day 3: December 04, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Contorl Flow, learning for-loop, range, if-else, switch, error, defer, panic, recover.

**Thoughts:** defer is a very useful keyword, it can be used to close file, release lock, print footer, etc. panic and recover is used to handle error, quickly return error and recover from panic.
